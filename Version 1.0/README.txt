Title: TTC NextBus XML Parser
Version: 1.0

Purpose:
This program was created in order to parse, and save bus locations, to a CSV file. It should be noted that this program, will only pull information in regards to one particular bus route. To elaborate, if the 505, bus route is entered within the final function, all busses currently operating on that route will be focused on. Additionally, since the function utilizes, a while loop, as well as current EPOCH timestamps, the most current locations will be focused on. Pandas was also used within this program, to help filter out old, and unneeded information.

Note:
In the next version, multithreading will be utilized to parse information for even more bus routes.
