Title: TTC NextBus XML Parser & Viewer
Version: 1.3

Purpose:
Unlike previous attempts, a database - PostgresSQL, was used to not only store parsed information, but also act as an intermediary for future queries. This switch was made as flat-files were deemed too simple, and did not provide the needed efficiency, or even benefit when compared to its alternatives. In order to view the data collected, a simple XY coordinate viewer was created in Matplotlib. Also, a time-lapse has been attached to help depict the realtime aspect of this creation. 

Version Note:
N/A

General Note:
As a general note, this attempt is a cumulation of all that I have learned from this project. And will be the last update; until a new - related project can be devised.
